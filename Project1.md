## Project 1
#**Describe what is a package? Also, describe what is a library? What are the two steps you need to execute in order to install a package and then make that library of functions accessible to your workspace and current python work session? Provide examples of how you would execute these two steps using two of the packages we have used in class thus far. Be sure to include an alias in at least one of your two examples and explain why it is a good idea to do so.**

A package is a bundle/ directory of python modules. A library is a group of packages or set of useful functions so that you do not have to write the code from scratch you can just use them after you import them. For example, pandas is a very useful function in data science because it is especially useful when working with data files. In Pycharm in order to execute a function you have to preferences and then python interpreter and install the packages that you want to use. From there in the terminal, you have to import the library that the user need.
For example:

From datetime import date
Import pandas as pd
Import numpy as np
Import math

By importing each of these libraries it allows the user to use the functions without having to write it themselves. Using an alias, such as when you are importing numpy and pandas allows people to use the alias, which is faster and shorter, when calling the functions that they want to use. Now instead of having to type out pandas every time the user only has to type out pd.
